DIRTY IGUANA

Cristopher just came out of the pet shop with a cute little iguana. He named her Samantha, now Samantha has a lot of troubles. Her cage needs to be cleaned out regularly multiple times a day!
Empirically Cristopher learned that in order to Samantha feel good her cage needs to be cleaned at least k times in two consecutive days. For eg. if k = 3 and yesterday christopher cleaned the cage 1 time today he needs to clean it 2 times so Samantha remains happy.
Christopher maintains a journal of daily tasks and he has made plans for the next n days writing a sequence of n integers a1, a2, ..., an where ai is the number of times christopher will clean the
cage on the i th day.
But Cristopher has made the journal according to his convenience. Make amends in the journal so that Samantha is not forgotten for all the n days. Write a program that will find the minimum number of times Christopher has to clean the cage.

INPUT

The first line contains the integer t, denoting the number of test cases. For each test case, the first line contains two space separated integers n and k (1 ≤ n, k ≤ 500) - the number of days and minimum number of times to clean the cage in 2 consecutive days.
The second line contains integers a1 , a2 , ..., an (0 ≤ ai≤ 500) - the number of times christopher has planned to clean the cage for n days in his journal.

OUTPUT

In the first line print the smallest number of times Cristopher should clean the cage so that Samantha feels good for n days.
In the second line print n integers b1, b2 , ..., bn , where bi — the total number of times cage cleaned on the i-th day according to the found solutions (ai ≤ bi for all i from 1 to n).
