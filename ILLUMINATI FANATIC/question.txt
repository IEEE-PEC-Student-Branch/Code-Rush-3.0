Illuminati Fanatic

Pasha is a member of mysterious Illuminati organization.
In an imaginary infinite plane there are infinite no of integer coordinates.
Pasha is obsessed with triangles and wants to construct triangles but his demands are dark. For a triangle to be considered an illuminati triangle it must enclose an odd number of integer coordinates and the area of the triangle must be an integer.
Write a program to help find pasha the maximum number of illuminati triangles that can be formed from n given coordinates, which are guaranteed not to lie on the same line.

INPUT

The first line contains the integer t, denoting the number of test cases. For each test case, the first line contains an integer n (3<n<6000), the number of coordinates which Pasha can choose as the vertices of the triangle.
Each of the next n lines contains two integers x and y (0≤x,y≤10^7) x,y are even where x and y are the coordinates of the vertices of the triangle. All coordinates are distinct and no three of them lie in the same line.

OUTPUT

Print the number of illuminati triangles that can be constructed. Two illuminati triangles are said to be different if constructed using three different coordinates.
